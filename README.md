# Curbside Pickup
## Overview
The Curbside Pickup App provides businesses across all industries the opportunity to offer customers curbside pickup service for online and phone purchases. Employees can view, in real-time, their store’s pickup orders, communicate with customers when their order is ready for pickup, easily locate customers upon arrival and deliver goods based on the customer’s pick-up preferences. This solution provides overall insights on fulfillment efficiencies and customers’ experiences.
